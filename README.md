### 5.9  printFactors
This program takes a number input and finds the factor of it. For example, when we input the number 24, we get the output of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Nothing is needed to run the code.

### 5.11 printHeads
This is a coin fliping program. The point of this program is to flip the coin on heads three times, when the program does that, it will stop and give an end statement. We use a Random object so that the output is different everytime. Nothing is needed to run the code.

### 5.18 digitSum
This program takes a number input and adds the digits of that number, for example, 32 would return 5. Nothing is needed to run the code.

### 5.24 isAllVowels
This program takes a string input and determines if it is a vowel only input. If the input contains anything other than a vowel, it will return false. If it is just vowels, it will return true. Nothing is needed to run the code.

### Project 5 Rock Paper Scissors
This program is a game of rock, paper, scissors. The user plays against the computer and chooses from one through three for the different options. The program runs smoothly, I ran into some issues when throwing an exception. Right now it can only take numbers, if you enter a letter you will get an error.
